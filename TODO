-Multithreading
-Rewrite crossover.
-Seed programs.

Emulation:
-Use intrinsics or inline/dedicated assembly.
-Emulate more instructions
-AVX?

Cost/Fitness:
-Use instruction timings for cost instead of just effective program length.
-Include a 'distance' in fitness calculation. So the algorithm is aware how far
    away the correct solution is.
-Allow the correct solution in any register.
